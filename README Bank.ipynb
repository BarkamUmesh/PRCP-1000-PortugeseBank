    "# Bank Marketing Campaign Prediction – Machine Learning Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📌 Project Overview\n",
    "This project aims to help a bank’s marketing team identify customers who are more likely to subscribe to a financial product using data analysis and machine learning. By predicting customer subscription probability, the bank can optimize marketing campaigns, reduce costs, and improve conversion rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Business Problem\n",
    "Banks spend significant resources on marketing campaigns. Contacting uninterested customers increases operational costs and reduces campaign efficiency.  \n",
    "The goal is to **predict whether a customer will subscribe to a product** so that marketing efforts can be focused on high-potential customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Objectives\n",
    "- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand customer behavior\n",
    "- Identify key features influencing subscription\n",
    "- Build and compare multiple ML models\n",
    "- Select the best model based on business-oriented metrics\n",
    "- Provide actionable recommendations to the marketing team\n",

    "## 📊 Dataset Description\n",
    "The dataset contains customer demographic, financial, and campaign interaction data such as:\n",
    "- Age, Job, Education\n",
    "- Contact type, Campaign duration\n",
    "- Previous campaign outcomes\n",
    "- Target variable: `Subscribed (Yes/No)`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "Key insights:\n",
    "- Customers aged 30–40 show higher subscription rates\n",
    "- Certain job categories (admin, technician, blue-collar) dominate subscriptions\n",
    "- Customers with successful previous campaigns are highly likely to subscribe again\n",
    "- Campaign duration strongly impacts conversion probability\n",
